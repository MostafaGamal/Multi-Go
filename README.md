A command line multi-tool made in Go, and aimed at security experts to make life a little more convenient. It does this by combining a massive array of different tasks, into one program.
### Currently capable of:
- file encryption/decryption
- file hashing
- DOS attack
- email
- scrape website
- password generator
- system info
### Working on (will add more over time):
- secure file deletion
- file compression/decompression
- check if account is breached (HaveIBeenPwned)
- toggle incoming connections
- system vulerability audit (online/offline modes)
## How to
### Download:
There isn't an offical executable yet. However, I should have one under 'releases' in the next week.
### Use:
1. Open the terminal
2. paste path to executable
3. follow that with "-t/--Task [task] -r/--Target [target]"
4. Note: the 'target' is optional, depending on the task

## Important
Multi Go is intended to be used on linux. It might run on Windows. Currently it isn't tested, nor supported! I will eventually work on a Windows patch
